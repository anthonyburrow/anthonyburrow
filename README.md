Hi! I'm Anthony.

I recently graduated from the University of Oklahoma in the Department of
Physics and Astronomy with a Ph.D. in Physics. You can see my research work and
publications [here](https://anthonyburrow.github.io/publications/). Many
repositories here host tools used in this work.

I am interested in data science, (numerical) software engineering, and even
game development!
